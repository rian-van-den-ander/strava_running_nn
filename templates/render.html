        <h4>Introduction - read carefully</h4>
        For this analysis, a machine learning model using data from all athletes has determined which training plan factors are most important in running fast, and you are judged in the context of those factors. This model is trained on your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Daniels_(coach)#VDOT" target="_blank">vdot</a>, or improvement thereof, using only your best races from Strava. Due to the mechanics of vdot, it is best applied to distances between 5k and a full marathon.
        
        <p><p>
        
        <b>Disclaimer:</b> There are factors that the model obviously does not take into account. It does not know when you were injured, what your diet was, what your weight was. It does not know anything about activities you did outside of Strava. But it does know all about every activity you did before you got that PB. Furthermore, the model is only as good as your data. If you haven't uploaded many activities to Strava, or don't wear a heart rate monitor, it's hard to estimate what you were actually doing, and how hard you were exercising.
        
        <h4>How to read the data</h4>
        If confused, please <a href="./about" target="_blank">read here</a>.

        <p>
        <h4>How do you compare to the best?</h4>
        Here, your last good period of training (before you ran your last PR) is compared to the best training periods of the best athletes. How do you add up versus the top athletes? This shouldn't be taken as instructions, but rather as an end goal, showing you what you should be working towards.   
        <br><br>
        The list is <b>ordered</b> by a combination of the importance of this aspect in anyone's training, and your performance in this aspect. So the higher up the item, the more you need to work on it according to the model.
        <br><br>
	The blue arrow indicates your performance in that item.

        <h4>How can you best improve, compared to the best improvements in fitness?</h4>
        
        The above was all about absolute fitness. On the next page, we look at relative changes that athletes made to get fitter, relative to your training.
